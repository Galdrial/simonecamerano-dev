            <p class="card-text">
              How I (almost) became a developer (Spoiler: It wasn’t planned)<br><br>
              I’ll be honest: I didn’t wake up at ten years old knowing I’d become a web developer. Sure, as a student
              at a classical high school, people considered me a nerd because instead of learning Latin and Greek, I
              spent my days staring at the screen, trying to figure out how GNU/Linux worked.<br><br>
              Unfortunately, I've never had the chance to choose my job or even my university. Life led me to start working
              very early, and for more than twenty years I was part of the vast world of Large-Scale Retail, covering
              both operational, as a Responsable, and commercial roles. I had my satisfactions, of course, but I always felt something wasn’t going as
              I wished.<br><br>
              Now, in my forties, I feel it’s finally time for me to build something that truly represents and fulfills me,
              both as a worker and as a person.<br><br>
              The idea of diving into Web Development wasn’t sudden but grew over time, until a few months ago I started
              studying the main programming languages, first self-taught (thank you, YouTube!) and then through more
              structured courses.<br>
              Python was my first love—it seemed simple and intuitive, within my reach. In a few months, by adding
              Django to my skills, I managed to deploy a small site, maybe trivial, but extremely rewarding.<br><br>
              I was trying to launch a small project (which, by the way, never took off), but between YouTube tutorials
              and nights of “just one more tweak before bed,” before I knew it, I wasn’t just fixing that site—I was
              rebuilding it from scratch. And I loved every minute, between frustration and excitement.<br><br>
              What won me over wasn’t just solving problems. It was
              the creative power. With code, I could turn abstract ideas into real, functional experiences. I could
              create a button that surprises users. I could optimize loading times and literally save people time. I
              could build something that didn’t exist yesterday.<br><br>
              Now I want to become a full-stack developer to combine design and functionality. I want to write clean
              code that makes sense to people, not just machines. I believe the best solutions are invisible and that
              users shouldn’t notice the technology, just enjoy the experience.<br><br>
              Why do I do it? Because every project is a new challenge, every bug is a puzzle, and every deploy is that
              moment of “wow, I really built this.”<br><br>
              Technology changes every day, and that’s exactly why I’m here—ready and determined to get back in the
              game, because I love learning, adapting, and building things that matter.

              The tools I use to turn ideas into reality.<br><br>
              FRONTEND DEVELOPMENT<br>
              I create responsive, accessible interfaces that are not only beautiful, but work perfectly.<br><br>
              • HTML5 & CSS3 – Semantic markup and modern styling<br>
              • JavaScript (ES6+) – Interactive, dynamic user experiences<br>
              • Sass/SCSS – Scalable, maintainable stylesheets<br>
              • Bootstrap – Rapid prototyping and responsive design<br>
              • Python & Django – My first love<br>
              • GNU/Linux – My inseparable companion, in coding and in life<br><br>
              BACKEND DEVELOPMENT<br>
              I build robust server solutions that power applications.<br><br>
              • Python – Automation and data management<br>
              • Django – Dynamic web applications<br><br>
              TOOLS & WORKFLOW<br>
              The ecosystem that keeps my development efficient and organized.<br><br>
              • Git & GitHub – Version control and collaboration<br>
              • VS Code – My editor of choice<br><br>
              SOFT SKILLS<br>
              The human side of development that makes a difference in projects.<br><br>
              • Problem Solving – Breaking down complex challenges into manageable solutions<br>
              • Collaboration – Working effectively with designers, PMs, and other developers<br>
              • Communication – Explaining technical concepts to non-technical people<br>
              • Continuous Learning – Staying up to date with new technologies<br>
              • Attention to Detail – Writing clean, bug-free code<br>

            </h4>
            <p class="card-text">
              How I work (and why it really matters)<br><br>
              My philosophy is simple: build things that matter.<br><br>
              Sounds basic, right? But here’s what it really means in practice:<br><br>
              QUALITY IS NON-NEGOTIABLE<br>
              I don’t deliver half-baked solutions. If my name is on it, it has to really work. Not “works on my
              machine,” but “tested, optimized, and bulletproof.” I’d rather spend an extra day doing it right than
              weeks fixing it later.<br><br>
              USERS ARE PEOPLE, NOT NUMBERS<br>
              Every button I code, every form I design, there’s a real person on the other side. Maybe they’re tired, in
              a hurry, or using their phone with one hand while holding coffee with the other one. I code for that reality, not for perfect
              conditions that don’t exist.<br><br>
              THE TEAM IS STRONGER THAN THE INDIVIDUAL<br>
              I used to think the best developers were soloists. I was wrong. The best work happens when developers,
              designers, and stakeholders really talk to each other. I ask questions, share doubts early, and celebrate
              wins with the team because great products aren’t built alone.<br><br>
              LEARNING NEVER STOPS<br>
              Technology evolves. What was cutting-edge last year is already old. I stay curious, read documentation,
              try new tools, and admit when I don’t know something—then I learn it. Ego is useless in
              development.<br><br>
              What makes me unique? I care about the code, the user, the team, and the result. I don’t just check boxes;
              I build solutions that really solve problems.

            <p class="card-text">
              When I’m not coding<br><br>
              Plot twist: I have a life outside VS Code. Surprising, I know.<br><br>
              SIDE PROJECTS & EXPERIMENTS<br>
              Okay, part of my “life outside coding” is… more coding. But it’s different! These are the projects nobody
              asked for, the “what if” experiments, the tools I build because I need them and they don’t exist yet. My
              GitHub is a graveyard of brilliant ideas and spectacular failures. No regrets.<br><br>
              GAMING (OF COURSE)<br>
              I’m a gamer. RPGs, strategy games, indie titles—I love them all. But now I can’t play without analyzing
              the UI, critiquing load times, and wondering how the backend works. The developer’s mind is both a
              blessing and a curse. But my greatest passion will always be flight simulation! So many hours spent with
              the cloche in hand!<br><br>
              MUSIC IS MY DEBUGGER<br>
              I code with music, preferably jazz. I think with music. I also play bass, guitar and a bit of everything (badly) and have a lot of
              fun.<br><br>
              GETTING OUTDOORS<br>
              Sitting all day is tough, so I force myself to go for long walks, with my partner Marina and our
              inseparable dog Fred.<br><br>
              Why share this? Because I'm human. I have interests, hobbies, weird
              obsessions, and a life beyond code. I think better, create better,
              and work better when I'm not just a developer—I'm a person who
              happens to develop.
