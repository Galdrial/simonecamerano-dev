            <p class="card-text">
              How I became a developer (Spoiler: It wasn’t planned)<br><br>
              I’ll be honest: I didn’t wake up at ten years old knowing I’d become a web developer.<br><br>
              My journey started with a broken website. I was trying to launch a small project (which, by the way, never took off), and the template I bought was a mess.<br>
              Instead of giving up, I opened the code. I had no idea what I was looking at, but something about those colorful lines intrigued me.<br><br>
              One YouTube tutorial led to another. One night of “just one more tweak” became dozens. Before I knew it, I wasn’t just fixing that site—I was rebuilding it from scratch. And I loved every minute, between frustration and excitement.<br><br>
              What won me over wasn’t just solving problems (though I love a good debugging session at 2 a.m.). It was the creative power. With code, I could turn abstract ideas into real, functional experiences. I could create a button that surprises users. I could optimize loading times and literally save people time. I could build something that didn’t exist yesterday.<br><br>
              Today, I’m a full-stack developer who combines design and functionality. I write clean code that makes sense to people, not just machines. I believe the best solutions are invisible—users shouldn’t notice the technology, just enjoy the experience.<br><br>
              Why do I do it? Because every project is a new challenge, every bug is a puzzle, and every deploy is that moment of “wow, I really built this.”<br><br>
              Technology changes every day, and that’s exactly why I’m here—I love learning, adapting, and building things that matter.

              How I Work (And Why It Matters) <br><br>

              I have a simple philosophy: build things that don't suck. <br> <br>

              Sounds basic, right? But here's what that actually means in
              practice: <br><br>

              QUALITY ISN'T NEGOTIABLE <br>
              I don't ship half-baked solutions. If I'm going to put my name on
              something, it needs to work—really work. Not "works on my machine"
              work, but "tested, optimized, and bulletproof" work. I'd rather
              take an extra day to do it right than spend weeks fixing it later. <br><br>

              USERS ARE HUMANS, NOT DATA POINTS <br>
              Every button I code, every form I design, there's a real person on
              the other side. <br>
              Maybe they're tired, maybe they're in a hurry, maybe they're using
              a phone with one hand while holding coffee. I build for that
              reality, not for perfect conditions that don't exist. <br><br>

              TEAMS > LONE WOLVES <br>
              I used to think the best developers were solo rockstars. <br>
              I was wrong. <br>
              The best work happens when developers, designers, and stakeholders
              actually talk to each other. <br>
              I ask questions. I share concerns early. I celebrate wins with the
              team because great products are never built alone. <br><br>

              LEARNING NEVER STOPS <br>
              Technology evolves. What was cutting-edge last year is legacy
              today. <br>
              I stay curious, read docs, experiment with new tools, and admit
              when I don't know something—then go learn it. Ego has no place in
              development. <br><br>

              MY CREATIVE PROCESS <br>
              Honestly? It's messy. I start with coffee and research. I sketch
              (badly) on paper. <br>
              I prototype fast and fail faster. I refactor religiously. I test
              obsessively. And somewhere in that chaos, something good emerges. <br><br>

              What makes me unique? I care—about the code, the user, the team,
              and the outcome. <br>
              I don't just check boxes; I build solutions that actually solve
              problems.

              When I'm Not Coding <br><br>

              Plot twist: I have a life outside of VS Code. Shocking, I know. <br><br>

              SIDE PROJECTS & EXPERIMENTS <br>
              Okay, so some of my "life outside coding" is... more coding. But
              hear me out—it's different! These are the projects nobody asked
              for, the "what if" experiments, the tools I build because I need
              them and they don't exist yet. My GitHub is a graveyard of
              brilliant ideas andspectacular failures. No regrets. <br><br>

              PHOTOGRAPHY <br>
              I shoot photos. Mostly landscapes, cityscapes, and whatever catches
              my eye. It started as a way to get away from screens, but I realized
              composition in photography is weirdly similar to UI design—balance,
              contrast, negative space, visual hierarchy. Now I can't unsee design
              principles everywhere. <br><br>

              GAMING (OBVIOUSLY) <br>
              I'm a gamer. RPGs, strategy games, indie experiments—I love them all.
              But I can't play games anymore without analyzing the UI, critiquing
              load times, and wondering about the backend architecture. Developer
              brain is a blessing and a curse. <br><br>

              MUSIC IS MY DEBUGGER <br>
              I code with music. I think with music. I have playlists for
              different moods: "Focus Mode" for deep work, "Debug Hell" for when
              nothing makes sense, and "Deploy Day" for when I'm feeling confident.
              I also play guitar badly and enjoy every minute of it. <br><br>

              GETTING OUTSIDE <br>
              Sitting all day is brutal, so I force myself outside—hiking, biking,
              walking, whatever. <br>
              Some of my best code ideas come when I'm nowhere near a computer.
              My brain needs to defrag sometimes. <br><br>

              COFFEE CONNOISSEUR (OKAY, ADDICT) <br>
              Let's be honest: I run on caffeine. I've explored every coffee shop
              in my area, I own too many brewing devices, and yes, I have opinions
              about beans. It's a problem, but I'm not solving it. <br><br>

              Why share this? Because I'm human. I have interests, hobbies, weird
              obsessions, and a life beyond code. I think better, create better,
              and work better when I'm not just a developer—I'm a person who
              happens to develop.
